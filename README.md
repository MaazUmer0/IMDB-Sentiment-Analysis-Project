## Project Overview

This project covers the following:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset and visualizing key features.
- **Model Building**: Implementing a deep learning-based classifier using LSTM.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualizations**: Presenting insights using Python visualization libraries.
- **Model Saving**: Saving and loading the trained model for future use.
